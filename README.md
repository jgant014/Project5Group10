These drop down menus are considered the main menu, and the student or teacher will be returned to their respective main menu each time they complete thier a task. Students can take any quiz in any course, however they can only view their own scores.

I will now explain the progression of what happens when each task is selected.
Note: Any time the user clicks the exit button or cancel, client.java will close.
